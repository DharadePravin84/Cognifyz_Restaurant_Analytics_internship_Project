Cognifyz Restaurant Analytics Project

This repository contains the code and documentation for the Cognifyz internship project focusing on restaurant analytics. The project is divided into three levels, each targeting different aspects of data analysis and machine learning.

Level 1: Data Exploration and Preprocessing
In this level, we explore the dataset, identify missing values, handle data types, and analyze the distribution of the target variable ("Aggregate rating"). We ensure data integrity and prepare it for further analysis.

Level 2: Table Booking, Price Range, and Feature Engineering
Level 2 dives deeper into the characteristics of restaurants by analyzing features related to table booking, price range, and performing feature engineering to extract additional insights from the data.

Level 3: Predictive Modeling, Customer Preference Analysis, and Data Visualization
At the final level, we leverage machine learning techniques to build predictive models for restaurant ratings, analyze customer preferences based on cuisine types, and create visualizations to gain insights into the dataset.

Each level is accompanied by its respective code, documentation, and analysis, providing a comprehensive understanding of the project's progression and insights gained at each stage.
